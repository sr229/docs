If you are considering to contribute to the documentation center, then we would like to appreciate you in advance!

However, we have some set guidelines to be able to consider your contribution to be in the live site. But if you fancy contributing still,
then keep on reading on our 3-step journey~!

## Reading the Contribution Guidelines

The first step is reading our Contribution Guidelines set in our [repository](). This will familiarize you what document layout
we accept.

Usually, we will inform you if we also find some convention violations before merging since we enforce Pull Request Reviews.

## Composing your contribution

After reading thoroughly the guidelines. It should be enough for you to understand the things we accept. If you're ready,
You can now start [authoring]() your desired entry to add.

Keep in mind there's a format that we follow, as imposed on the guidelines, so make sure you follow that strictly!

## Submitting it upstream

After all the painstaking toils of your hard work, it has to pay off by appearing Sayonika's public frontend. And to do that -
you must submit a [Pull Request]().

A representative of Sayonika will review your Pull Request and if they think it's too awesome it needs to be there, they'll merge it!
How cool is that?

## What's next?

After your first PR gets merged, you should be encouraged to contribute more, since you'll give everyone new knowledge to study! 
(implying they like reading - but hey!) 

And of course, don't forget to celebrate if your PR got merged!
